# 🏙️ New York Airbnb EDA Project (2024)

This project is a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the **New York City Airbnb listings dataset (2024)**. Using powerful Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, I explored and visualized more than **20,000 listings** to uncover insights into prices, availability, room types, and neighborhood dynamics.

## 📌 Objective

- Analyze Airbnb listings in NYC to find patterns in:
  - Pricing trends
  - Room type distribution
  - Availability across neighborhoods
- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis
- Visualize key insights using data visualizations

---

## 🧪 Project Workflow

### 1. Setup & Library Imports
- Imported essential Python libraries:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### 2. Dataset Loading
- Loaded the 2024 NYC Airbnb dataset

### 3. Data Exploration
- Viewed dataset structure and dimensions
- Analyzed data types and value distributions

### 4. Data Cleaning
- Identified and handled missing/null values
- Removed duplicates and fixed inconsistencies

### 5. Univariate Analysis
- Explored individual columns like:
  - Price
  - Room Type
  - Availability

### 6. Outlier Detection
- Used boxplots and statistical logic to detect and filter out extreme values

### 7. Pandas GroupBy Operations
- Aggregated data for better comparison across:
  - Neighborhood groups
  - Room types
  - Price categories

### 8. Feature Engineering
- Created new features for better interpretation, such as:
  - Price range buckets
  - Availability level

### 9. Bivariate Analysis
- Analyzed relationships between:
  - Neighborhood vs. Price
  - Room Type vs. Availability
  - Price vs. Number of Reviews

### 10. Advanced Analysis & Visualizations
- Generated:
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Histograms
  - Pairplots
  - Bar charts and countplots
- Extracted insights on host behavior, room availability, and neighborhood trends

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Private rooms** are more affordable and have wider availability across boroughs.
- **Manhattan listings** tend to be the most expensive with low availability.
- **Entire homes/apartments** dominate the higher price brackets.
- **Outliers** (extremely high-priced listings) skew data — filtering improves clarity.
- **Neighborhoods** like Brooklyn and Queens offer budget-friendly listings with better availability.
